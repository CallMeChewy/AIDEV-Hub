# Codename: Himalaya

## Project Overview

Himalaya is a testament to the benefits of AI/Human collaboration. The primary goal is to develop a comprehensive, multi-faceted application that demonstrates how AI can be seamlessly integrated into workflows while also enhancing the project development lifecycle.

## Objectives

- Develop an application that exemplifies AI integration in both workflow and software development.
- Adhere to **PEP 8** standards, except for **AIDEV-PascalCase** naming conventions.
- Emphasize **modular design**, ensuring no single code module exceeds 500 lines.
- Implement:
  - **Unit testing**
  - **Error handling**
  - **In-line debugging and progress diagnostics**
  - **Detailed internal documentation**
- Evolve mission statements and standards dynamically throughout the development process.

## Project Architecture

Himalaya is designed to create an environment tailored for AI integration in applications. This involves:

- A **dual-layer architecture**:
  1. **The Internal Project** - A standard application architecture used in typical projects.
  2. **The Supporting Environment** - The outer layer providing essential AI-enhanced tools to the internal project.
- **Project within a project:** The core application will be developed within an architecture that also supports AI-driven tooling.

## Internal Project: `OllamaModelEditor`

This application will provide an environment for **LLM Model Maintenance**, growing over time to incorporate advanced AI-driven features such as:

- **Database management**
- **Chat interface**
- **AI-driven advice and security monitoring**
- **TTL (Time-to-Live) management**
- **Voice recognition**
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) support with vector database**
- **Multi-level memory for persistence**
- **Additional AI-powered functionalities** as the project evolves.

## First User Application Example: Ollama Model Editor

### About

Ollama Model Editor is a comprehensive GUI application that allows users to customize, optimize, and manage Ollama AI models. It provides an intuitive interface for adjusting model parameters, comparing performance across different configurations, and streamlining AI workflows.

### Features
