# Comprehensive Test Plan for AIDEV-Hub

## 1. Testing Strategy

Based on the existing test files and architecture, here's a comprehensive testing strategy:

### 1.1. Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
   - Each core component tested independently
   - Mock dependencies to isolate component behavior
   - High coverage of normal and error paths

2. **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions
   - Database operations with actual SQLite store
   - File system interactions 
   - Inter-component communication

3. **Crash Recovery Tests**: Testing session continuity features
   - Simulated crashes at different points
   - Session state validation after crashes
   - Resumption of crashed sessions
   - Lock file handling

4. **Thread Safety Tests**: Testing concurrent operations
   - Multiple threads accessing shared resources
   - Lock acquisition and release
   - Race condition detection

5. **Performance Tests**: Testing system under load
   - Large dataset handling
   - Multiple concurrent sessions
   - Resource cleanup

### 1.2. Test Environment

- Isolated test directories for each test run
- In-memory SQLite database where appropriate
- Test-specific configuration values
- Mocked external dependencies
- Custom test fixtures for common setup/teardown

## 2. Component-Specific Test Plans

### 2.1. DatabaseManager Tests (test_database_manager.py)

Already implemented tests:
- Database initialization
- Query execution
- Transaction handling
- Update/delete operations
- Backup functionality
- Logging functionality

Additional tests to implement:
- Connection pooling with multiple threads
- Error recovery after connection failures
- Large dataset handling
- Schema migration tests

### 2.2. SessionManager Tests (test_session_manager.py)

Already implemented tests:
- Session creation/termination
- Message recording
- State persistence
- Session info retrieval
- Crash detection

Additional tests to implement:
- Long-running session handling
- Session timeout behavior
- Race conditions with multiple sessions
- Maximum session size handling

### 2.3. Crash Recovery Tests (test_crash_recovery.py)

Already started tests:
- Basic crash detection
- Crash report generation
- Session resumption

Additional tests to implement:
- Crash during state save operations
- Crash during database transactions
- Multiple concurrent crashes
- Crash during recovery operations
- Partial file system failures

### 2.4. ConfigManager Tests (test_config_manager.py)

Tests to implement:
- Configuration loading and caching
- Type conversion (string to typed values)
- Default value handling
- Configuration updates and persistence
- Group configuration handling
- Import/export functionality

### 2.5. ActionTracker Tests (test_action_tracker.py)

Tests to implement:
- Action recording and status updating
- Action execution with success and failure cases
- Action history retrieval
- Filtering actions by type/status
- Action statistics

### 2.6. ContextManager Tests (test_context_manager.py)

Tests to implement:
- Context setting and retrieval
- Namespaced context operations
- Context clearing (specific keys and all)
- Session-bound context validation
- Context transfer between sessions

### 2.7. ValidationManager Tests (test_validation_manager.py)

Tests to implement:
- Rule registration and retrieval
- Input validation against rules
- Field validation
- Object validation (multiple fields)
- Rule import/export

### 2.8. ContinuityDocGenerator Tests (test_continuity_doc_generator.py)

Tests to implement:
- Document generation for active sessions
- Final document generation
- Crash report generation
- Content extraction from various states
- Template rendering

### 2.9. StateManager Integration Tests (test_state_manager.py)

Tests to implement:
- Component coordination
- Cross-component workflows
- Error propagation
- Session lifecycle management
- Consistent state across components

## 3. Test File Implementation Plan

```

## 4. Test Execution Strategy

### 4.1 Regular Test Execution

- Run unit tests with each code change
- Run integration tests before merging to main branch
- Automate testing in CI pipeline if available

### 4.2 Coverage Goals

- Aim for minimum 85% code coverage across all components
- 100% coverage of critical paths (session continuity and crash recovery)
- Focus on edge cases in state transitions

### 4.3 Test Documentation

- Document any complex test setups and test fixture patterns
- Include test data generation methods where needed
- Document any manual testing steps that can't be automated

## 5. Security and Edge Case Testing

- Test with invalid/malformed input
- Test with very large datasets
- Test resource exhaustion scenarios
- Test file permission edge cases
- Test simultaneous access scenarios

## 6. Test Maintenance Strategy

- Review and update tests with each API change
- Maintain test-specific utilities separate from application code
- Use consistent mocking patterns across test modules
- Keep test fixtures modular and composable
