# Local AI Task: [Task Name]
**Created: [Month Day, Year] [Time AM/PM]**

## Task Header
- **Task ID**: [Unique identifier]
- **Component Name**: [Component being modified]
- **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Estimated Complexity**: [Simple/Moderate/Complex]
- **Dependencies**: [Any components or standards required]

## Implementation Requirements
- **Objective**: [Clear statement of what needs to be accomplished]
- **Current Limitations**: [Issues being addressed]
- **Expected Behavior**: [How the component should function after implementation]
- **User Experience Goals**: [How this affects the end user]

## Timestamp Requirements
- Every modified code file must have its "Last Modified" timestamp updated
- Format: `# Last Modified: YYYY-MM-DD  HH:MM{AM|PM}`
- Note: Two spaces must separate the date and time
- Use 12-hour time format with AM/PM designation
- This is a critical requirement for all code modifications

## AIDEV-PascalCase Quick Reference
[Condensed version of key standards relevant to this task]

```python
# Example of correct naming conventions
class DataProcessor:
    def ProcessUserInput(self, InputData: dict) -> None:
        self.CurrentValue = InputData['Value']
        self.LastModified = self.GetTimestamp()
```

*"Code is not merely functional—it is a visual medium that developers interact with for extended periods. The choices made in these standards prioritize the axis of symmetry, character distinction, readability at scale, and visual hierarchy."*

— Herbert J. Bowers
